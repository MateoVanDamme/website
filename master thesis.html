            <p class="lead text-center">
                I was fortunate enough to take on my joint thesis at the Infusion research unit at UGent. I completed it
                together with my talented colleague-student Casper Haems.
                His portfolio is
                available <a href="https://casper.wvg.be/home/" target="_blank">here</a>
                The paper itself is unfortunately under embargo
                until it gets cleared by JET. I can however say that I got a 18/20 and that a paper that will be
                published is currently being written based on our research. When the paper gets cleared in 2024 I will
                expand this page to include more detail.

                            Nuclear fusion is a promising source of energy. It has the potential to provide a clean and
                            sustainable source of electricity for the future. One of the most common and promising
                            approaches is the use of a donut-shaped vessel called the ”tokamak”. A favorable mode of
                            operation in tokamaks is H-mode (or high confinement mode). However, the occurrence of
                            harmful
                            events called edge-localized modes (ELMs) during H-mode poses a significant challenge.
                            Understanding and therefore detecting ELMs is a crucial part of the research and development
                            of
                            nuclear fusion. Simple ELM detection methods exist but do not suffice for more difficult
                            types
                            of ELMs.
                            <br><br>
                            The objective of this master’s dissertation is to develop methods that can accurately and
                            reliably detect multiple ELM types based on data from real tokamak devices. This requires
                            identifying and extracting relevant features from the data. Mathematical transformations and
                            machine learning techniques are employed to identify and
                            extract features from the data. Noise removal techniques are utilized to filter
                            high-frequency
                            variations and random fluctuations while preserving essential low-frequency information for
                            ELM
                            detection. Multiple ELM detection methods are developed, each employing different approaches
                            and
                            having their advantages and disadvantages. The performance of these methods is evaluated and
                            compared
                            with existing methods.
                            <br><br>
                            In conclusion, this masters dissertation addresses ELM detection
                            challenges in tokamak reactors by developing robust methods. Through mathematical
                            transformations and machine learning
                            techniques applied to real JET data, it contributes to nuclear fusion research. These
                            findings
                            pave the way for efficient ELM research, advancing the goal of fusion energy realization.

                            Most of the data used in the thesis originated from the JET fusion device. Located in

                            fusion device on earth and will remain so until ITER becomes operational in 2025. The torus
                            has an outer diamater of 3 metres and holds 90 cubic metres of plasma. During a single
                            'pulse' of operation up to 18 GB of data is collected.
